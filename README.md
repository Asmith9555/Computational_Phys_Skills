This repository contains all of my completed skills for the class, Computational Physics at the University of Central Arkansas taught by Dr. Jeremy Lusk in the Spring of 2020. The skills referenced through-out the repository are contained on the pdf file titled "master_skill_sheet" and are coded as: 

"3-Letter Code for Section"-"Letter Grade Associated with skill":"Index"

The contained directories are titled with the respective 3-letter code and contain files that either conduct the asked skill or explain how once conducts the referenced skill. The file name of each file corresponds with the skills explained inside...

** On the master skill sheet, if the blank next a skill is marked 'done', there likely won't be a corresponding file explaining the skill. This is likely because I had already displayed the skill in person and do not have a log made. An attempt may be made to fill this gap in the future.
