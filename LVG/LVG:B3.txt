This skill is that I can reset to a previous version of a local git repository,
which can be done with the following command:

For resting a specific commit:

$ git reset --soft <commit-hash>

or resetting before the most recent commit

$ git reset --soft HEAD-1

soft is used to keep changes made in the working directory.
