The skill is I can add multiple lines of text to a file without leaving the
terminal. For one there are alot of text editors that work inside the terminal
(nano, vim, emacs, etc.), however this is still technically leaving the terminal.
To add lines without leaving the terminal the following code can be used:

$ echo "Line_1" >> <fileName>
$ echo "Line_2" >> <fileName>
$ echo "Line_2" >> <fileName>
...etc.
